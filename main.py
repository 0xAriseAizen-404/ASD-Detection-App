    ### Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) Notice
    Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a developmental condition that affects communication, behavior, and social interaction in varying degrees. Early detection and intervention can significantly improve outcomes. Our app is designed to assist in screening and understanding ASD through innovative tools and games.

    #### Features of Our App
    - **Quiz Test**: Answer a series of questions to assess potential ASD traits using a trained XGBoost model.
    - **Gaming Tests**: Engage in interactive games (Emoji Recognition, Memory, Ball Clicker) to evaluate cognitive and behavioral patterns.
    - **Audio Analysis**: Upload audio recordings to analyze vocal patterns for ASD indicators using machine learning models.
    - **Image Analysis**: Submit images to detect autism-related features with a pre-trained neural network.
    - **Chatbot**: Get personalized analysis and support by uploading reports or asking questions.

    #### Precautions and Suggestions
    - **Consult Professionals**: This app is a screening tool, not a diagnostic replacement. Always consult a healthcare professional for a formal diagnosis.
    - **Privacy**: Ensure personal data is handled securely and not shared without consent.
    - **Engagement**: Encourage participation in all tests for a comprehensive screening experience.
    - **Awareness**: Learn about ASD symptoms like delayed speech, repetitive behaviors, or social challenges to better understand the condition.
